# Simple **stack buffer overflow** 

These are simple C programs that expose a stack injection vulnerablity. Those
programs perform some memory operations without control the allocate memory
size.

## Goal
The main goal of these challenge is to run arbitrary code (a shellcode) on the
host machine exploiting the stack buffer overflow vulnerability. 

## Compiling programs
For compiling the program just type the command make.
